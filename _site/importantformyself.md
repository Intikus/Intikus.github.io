any time i want to work on site
run:
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental


copy paste Server adress to firefox (ctrl click works too :))

_site is the local build that is generated and maintained by ruby
can stage and stuff if you don't want them green? otherwise ignore

and then ctrl+c on the terminal when doneÂ¨

then also push it and sync it and bop it and pull(no don't pull it that's not what i do) it  after all this to actually have it done
